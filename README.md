#Customer Segmentation & Clustering

Project: Creating Customer Segments and Clustering

In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers that will allow us to perform customer segmentation on a specific group of mall 
customers. 
We will identify the best possible cluster using K-MEANS UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM to find the univariate, bivariate and multivariate clusters.
Once these clusters are identified, summary statistics can be perform on these to identify the best marketing group.
